/**
 * @brief This namspace provides all the classes needed to run a shell interface to run the lucid project that genrates
 * a simplified user and read friendly html page of web articles.
 *
 *  This namespace creates an interface to the Lucid project.
 *  The lucid project is a tool to html of online articles that are only the article text and critical information.
 *  The goal is to create a better reading experiance devoid of add and annoying layouts that is clutterd with garbage.
 *
 * This name space is devided into 3 parts.
 * The core: The shell class - responsible of managing all the interaction with the user (getting command input)
 *           and executing the Lucid functionalities wich will be described bellow.
 * The commands: implemented as an abstract Command class with the fallowing extensions:
 *                  1.load "URL" - the starting command of the given URL path.
 *                  2.addAnalysis/removeAnalysis - genrates ai analysis (using open ai) and adds to article.
 *                  3.exportTo "Directory" - exports the html file of the article in the givin "DIrectory" path.
 *                  4.open - opens the current loaded article with the default local browser
 *
 * @note **CRITICAL ASSUMPTION:** This entire library is designed for and
 * tested only on **Windows 64-bit** platforms.
 *
 * @note **CRITICAL ASSUMPTION:** This entire library need the user to to have a open AI API key,
 * and to set it as an environment variable by fallowing these steps.
 * 1.open Poweshell.
 * 2. input: $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
 *
