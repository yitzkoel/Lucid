Project goals:
1. create noise free article layout (nothing but the article and assistive data).
2. add LLM to webpage with quires (maby summery maby critic);
3. give articles layout based on different political bias(not sure how to implement maby an opposing suggested view
at the end of the article with a link)
4. Optional: adding features to 2: having at he same page apposing views with LLM generated analysis. 
5. Very far ambition : a truth Monitor, a easily accessed database that hold the records of officials and media people
opions and recorded dishonesty, (can have video, audio, court records, police record and every data publicly available
to back it up).

The goals are listed in order of importance and progression.


must do improvments (performance)
5. add timing breakdown to locate where is the time goint when loading a html to locate biggest bottle neck
and see if you can improve it.
goal: load command should feel instantanios (under 100 ms please see if there a tool that can mesure).
8. maby make article desighner get article and is able to reset if loaded a new article saves space and better desighn.
9. maby make htmlExtractor extract to a local string nd pass it on to increase speed.

must do to extend:
Currently I can only handle sites that hve thier artical in the explicit html page, but some sites have thier artical
generated by js dynamiclly making it invisible to curl request.
After a little research i saw a few options.
1. try to find a js interperter to import into the cpp code.
2. Write a js that can extract such articals from a html i downloaded with curl.
And then call a external js interperter with that js that was writen to generate a new html page and parse that page.
3. add a browser to cpp code.
4. do 2 but with a browser(not a js interperter)
the reason for 3 or 4 is somthing called DOM that i didnt understand what it really is but basicly a js interperter will
not be able to run it and that requires a browser.
